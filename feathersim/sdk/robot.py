"""Developer-facing skill SDK: a ``Robot`` facade over the sim. [Phase 3]

Hides joints, MJCF, kinematics, and controller wiring behind four skills — ``move_to``, ``pick``,
``place``, ``tend`` — plus a ``wait_until_done`` helper. Because the robot is a mobile base with no
arm, parts are modeled as *logical* handoffs: ``pick`` unloads a ``done`` machine (which then
auto-reloads and resumes its cycle) and ``place`` deposits the part onto the output table. Every
skill checks its preconditions and raises :class:`SkillError` rather than doing something nonsensical.
